## 4. User Study

We conducted a web-based user study to evaluate human performance in cursor steering and selection tasks across three interaction paradigms. We recruited [N] participants through Prolific, requiring desktop/laptop computers with physical mice (trackpads excluded) and default mouse sensitivity settings. The experiment was implemented as a React web application rendered on an HTML5 Canvas (460 × 260 pixels, scaled to 0.4608 m × 0.2592 m physical dimensions), with cursor position and velocity sampled at 100 Hz throughout each trial. Participants completed three task types in fixed order: (1) steering trials where they navigated a cursor through constrained paths (tunnels) of varying difficulty, requiring precise boundary control while moving from start to target; (2) lasso selection trials where they drew freeform loops around target icons in grid layouts while avoiding distractors; and (3) cascading menu navigation trials where they hovered over menu items to reveal submenus and selected target items. Each task type was preceded by practice trials, and conditions within each type were randomized to control for order effects. The experiment took approximately 15–20 minutes per participant, and we recorded completion time, success rate, full trajectory paths, speed profiles, boundary violations, and selection accuracy for all trials.
